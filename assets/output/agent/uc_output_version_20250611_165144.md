The business value is in streamlining the intake process, reducing manual entry for staff, and providing immediate feedback to the filer.

- **Postconditions**: ["A new 'Petition' data object is created in the system with a status of 'Submitted'.", 'A unique case ID is generated and associated with the new petition.', 'All uploaded documents are stored and linked to the case ID.', "An automated confirmation email, containing the case ID, is sent to the public user's provided email address.", 'The new case is placed in the initial processing queue for internal review.']

- **Preconditions**: ["The public user has an active internet connection and access to the system's portal.", 'The user has all necessary information and digital copies of supporting documents ready for upload.']

### Process Internal Case

- **ID**: UC-002
- **Actor**: ['Staff Member']
- **Description**: Enables an authorized internal staff member to review, manage, and process a submitted case. This includes accessing case details, validating submitted information, updating the case status, adding internal notes, and routing the case for further action or decision. This is a core function for moving a case through its lifecycle.

- **Postconditions**: ["The 'Petition' data object's status is updated (e.g., to 'Under Review', 'Accepted', 'Rejected').", 'An audit log is created or updated, recording the actions taken by the staff member and the timestamp.', "New 'Case Note' data objects may be created and associated with the case.", 'The case may be reassigned to another user or queue, updating its assignment attribute.']

### Generate Management Report

- **ID**: UC-003
- **Actor**: ['Manager']
- **Description**: Allows a manager to generate and view aggregate reports based on system data. The manager can specify parameters like date ranges, case types, and staff assignments to analyze key performance indicators such as case volume, processing times, and outcomes. This supports strategic planning and performance oversight.

- **Postconditions**: ['A report is generated and displayed to the manager.', 'The manager has the option to export the generated report in a standard format (e.g., PDF, CSV).', "The system's underlying data objects (Petitions, Case Notes) are only read; no data is created or modified by this use case."]
