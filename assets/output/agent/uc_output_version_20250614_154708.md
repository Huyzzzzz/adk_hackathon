### Check Payment Status

- **ID**: UC-002

### Escalate Inquiry to Human Agent

- **ID**: UC-003

### Manage Knowledge Base

- **ID**: UC-004
- **Actor**: ['Human Agent']
- **Description**: A human agent with administrative rights adds, modifies, or removes information (e.g., FAQs, program details, policies) in the system's knowledge base. This ensures the information provided by the automated system is accurate, relevant, and current.

- **Postconditions**: ['The knowledge base is updated with the new or modified content.', 'The changes are immediately live and accessible to the automated inquiry system.', 'A log of the changes, including who made them and when, is recorded.']

- **Preconditions**: ['The human agent is authenticated and has administrative privileges.', 'The agent has identified a need to create new content or update existing information.']
