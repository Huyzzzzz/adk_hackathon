### Actor Hierarchy

The System Administrator has the highest level of control, managing all system functions and data. Primary Actors, like the Customer, interact directly with the system's core features. Other Stakeholders, such as the Marketing Manager, do not operate the system directly but rely on its data outputs to perform their roles. The Administrator oversees the entire ecosystem.

### Stakeholder Summary

The primary actors who directly use the system are Customers (for purchasing) and System Administrators (for management). Customers drive the system's core purpose, while Administrators ensure its smooth operation. Key stakeholders, like the Marketing Manager, have a vested interest in the system's success and use its data for strategic planning but are not direct, hands-on users of its daily transactional functions. Their requirements influence the system's reporting and promotional capabilities.
