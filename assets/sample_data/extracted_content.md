    Virtual Agent Solution 
    University of California San Diego 
    
    1. Purpose of the RFI 
    The University of California San Diego (“UC San Diego”) is seeking information from qualified vendors to 
    provide a virtual agent solution that can help support the needs of multiple departments and our 
    diverse clientele, including external clients, vendors, visiting scholars, students, staff, and more. The goal 
    of this initiative is to provide excellent customer service and reduce total case volume by leveraging a 
    virtual agent that can pull information from our commonly used systems, such as Oracle, 
    PaymentWorks, and Concur. 
    UC San Diego invites you to review this RFI and respond to the questions listed under the “Response 
    Requirements” section of this document. We expect to receive your full response via CalUsource (UC’s 
    electronic bid website) by the deadline indicated under RFI Schedule section. Your responses will be 
    instrumental in UC San Diego’s understanding of virtual agents that are available in the current 
    marketplace. 
    For the respondents who appear to meet UC San Diego’s needs and who are determined responsible, 
    the UC San Diego evaluation team may decide to gather additional information and invite the suppliers 
    to participate in an in-person or webinar presentations, and product proof of concept. This invitation is 
    not guaranteed and subject to change. 
    This RFI is a mechanism for gathering information and does not constitute a binding procurement 
    process, however, purchases of goods and/or services may result from information obtained through 
    the RFI process, where deemed appropriate. Please note that UC San Diego is not obligated to make an 
    award or issue an RFP as part of this process. In addition, UC San Diego, in its sole discretion, may decide 
    to engage in direct question and answer sessions with one or more agencies and may decide to enter 
    into an agreement based upon those discussions/interviews and resulting proposal.  
    The ideal supplier/system/service should meet the following: 
    Requirements 
    API Capabilities: 
    The virtual agent solution must have the ability to integrate with our existing systems, including Oracle, 
    PaymentWorks, and Concur (can provide a more comprehensive list at a later time) to retrieve status 
    updates and provide accurate information to our clients.  
    
    Supply Chain Management: 
    The virtual agent should have knowledge and understanding of supply chain management principles and 
    practices, particularly in the context of higher education institutions.

    content needs.

    The virtual agent should be easy to use, with flexible update capabilities and mobile compatibility. 
    Multilingual support should be integrated into these features. 
    Desired Outcomes

    need for human intervention and improving overall customer satisfaction. 
    
    Reduced Case Volume: 
    By providing easy access to status updates and other information, the virtual agent solution should help 
    reduce the total case volume and alleviate the workload of our human agents. 
    
    Optimized Workflows: 
    The virtual agent solution should help optimize our workflows, reducing the time and resources required 
    to address routine inquiries and freeing up staff to focus on more complex and high-value tasks. 
    Enhanced Student Support and Retention:

    especially through bilingual capabilities that assist a diverse student population. This includes providing 
    essential support to students, parents, and guardians.

    Streamlined Information Access: 
    The virtual agent should serve as a key interface for delivering information about study abroad programs

    2. Background 
    UC San Diego is a higher education institution that strives for innovation and excellence. Our campus 
    community relies on various systems and tools to manage daily operations, including procurement, 
    invoicing, and payment processing. However, we receive a high volume of inquiries related to status 
    updates, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive to address. We believe that a virtual 
    agent solution can help optimize our workflows, reduce case volume, and improve overall customer 
    satisfaction.
